                        <p>
                            I've been experiencing hardships brought by the current situation yet it has 
                            brought me closer to my course and technology that helps me interact with 
                            others and learn how to bond with interactions mostly through games.
                            <br/><br/>
                            It's been hard to manage one's time with all the workload and the holidays were 
                            too short to enjoy.
